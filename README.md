-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 1.0.2:

  Added new quests to the Thaumcraft, Getting Started, and Adventures In Technology.
  New title screen design using the Custom Main Menu mod by Lumien231.
  Added New Tabs in the HQM book: "Applied Energistics", "Broken Recipes".
  Temporarily fixed the issue where Ex Nihilo Sieve is uncraftable by adding an infinitely repeatable quest in the tab: "Broken      Recipes" that requires all crafting components for an Ex Nihilo sieve that gives the reward of a sieve.
  The HQM book is now automatically enabled, as is Hardcore Mode. The book does not seem to be enabling from the config so            command blocks at (0,80,3000000) enable the book. To disable the book you will need to destroy them. The box is warded and       will teleport all players in survival mode and a radius of 70 back to 0,0.
